# How to use it

After opening the Retimer, you will need to right click the Yourube/Google Drive video and click the **Stats for Nerds** button.

After you have done that, you will see the video stats in the top left corner of the video, here is where all the information you will need

Right next to the video resolution, you will see a `@xx` number, the number after the `@` is the framerate. Instert that number into the `Framerate` Text box

After you have done that, go to the first frame and last frame (you can go bettwen frames by using `,` an `.`) and right click on the video again and click `Copy Debug Info` and put that information on the `Start` and `End` Text Box

After you have done all that, you can press `Calculate` and you will get your final time. you can press the `Copy Mod Message to Clipboard` to copy the mod message.

And to clear all the text boxes, you can click the `Clear` button and it will clear the text boxes.
