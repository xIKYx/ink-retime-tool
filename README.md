# icky-retime-tool
A YouTube tool to be able to retime videos

This code is a fork of ihavenolife (randomidiot13) for creating this code. I just modified it to add the Mod Message

# How to download it
**You will need to have Python 3.x or above**

You can go and download the file thats called (**icky-retime-tool**) you dont need the rest of the files

After that, add it to your desktop and duble click it, if evrything goes well, it should runn the file and open a small window.

That's it! you can now retime runs using YouTube's Stats for nerds debug info

(This will only work if you use the **__Copy Debug Info__** for this to retime, you cant insert your own time thats why calculator.com exist)
